Description: Package utilizes parmetirc bootstrapping and phylogenetic independent contrasts to identify 
nodes in a phylogeny that could be problematic for comparative analysis. Most comparative analysis rely 
on Brownian Motion (BM) or Ornstein Uhlenbeck (OU) models of evolution. If closely related or sister 
species diverge in their trait values, models using BM or OU process can lead to misinterpreted results. 
This package is intended to highlight nodes that the user should be cautious of while performing comparative 
anaylsis of continuous traits.
