Package name: noProbs

noProbs usilizes parmetirc bootstrapping to identify nodes in a phylogeny that could be problematic for comparative analysis. Most comparative analysis rely on Brownian Motion (BM) or Ornstein Uhlenbeck (OU) models of evolution. If closely related or sister species diverge in their trait values, models using BM or OU process can lead to misinterpreted results. This package is intended to highlight nodes that the user should be cautious of while performing comparative anaylsis by employing parametric bootstrapping and phylogenetic independent contrasts.

for installation use:
'install.packages("noProbs")'
librbay(noProbs)



```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
```

## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
